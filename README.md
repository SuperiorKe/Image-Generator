# Image-to-Image Translation with CycleGAN

This project demonstrates an image-to-image translation application using CycleGAN, implemented with Python, Flask, and PyTorch. It allows users to upload an image and generate a transformed version based on the uploaded image using a pre-trained CycleGAN model.

## Features

- **Pre-trained CycleGAN Model:** Utilizes a CycleGAN model for image-to-image translation.
- **Flask Web Application:** Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing generated results.
- **Image Processing:** Automatically transforms and normalizes uploaded images for processing.
- **Dynamic Display:** Generated images are displayed in real-time on the results page.

## How It Works

1. **Upload an Image:** Users can upload any image through the web interface.
2. **Image Processing:** The uploaded image undergoes processing using the CycleGAN model.
3. **View Results:** The transformed image is displayed on the results page, showcasing the translation.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/image-to-image-translation.git
   cd image-to-image-translation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.
